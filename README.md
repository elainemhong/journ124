I chose this question because I was intereseted in seeing how it compared to the data of "In general, is it rude to knowingly bring unruly children on a plane?" For the alternate question, 41% answered, "Yes, somewhat rude" and another 41% answered, "Yes, very rude." The data of the uploaded files show that, in comparison, 70% of the same respondents believe it is "No, not at all rude" to bring a baby on a plane.
